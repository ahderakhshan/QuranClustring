**Quran Verses Clustring**

In this project, the Persian translation of the verses of the Qur'an are first pre-processed with the Hazm library,
then each verse is converted into a vector using Tf-Idf. In the next step, using these vectors, the verses are clustered into 100 clusters,
which will make the thematic investigation of the verses of the Qur'an easier for researchers.
The results are also stored in the 100babes file. It is also written in the subject file what keywords each cluster represents.
This project is a suitable project because many religious texts have been collected without subject classification and this idea can 
be used in other texts to quickly organize the subject and help researchers.
